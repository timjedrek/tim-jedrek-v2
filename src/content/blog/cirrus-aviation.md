> Tim and his team at Right Rudder are such a great find for aviation companies in need of a professional touch to their marketing portfolio. In my 24 years of experience at Cirrus Aviation Flight Training, it has always been so difficult to find and retain someone with creative abilities that understands aviation, and consistently produces results. Right Rudder understands the industry, produces context-correct content with tracked results, all with a smile. <br><br> - Nayda, Cirrus Aviation

We worked with Nayda and her team at Cirrus Aviation between December 2023 and May 2024 and they were a delight to work with.  While we did not implement the [FSMS](https://rightruddermarketing.com/marketing-system) for them where we overhaul their website and create a marketing campaign online through [PPC advertising](https://rightruddermarketing.com/how-to-enroll-more-students-with-google-ads-in-2024), [SEO](https://rightruddermarketing.com/flight-school-seo), and [reputation management](https://rightruddermarketing.com/how-to-optimize-google-my-business-2024); we did provide marketing consultation services and web development work during our time together.

On the technical side, we helped fix broken forms, remove extraneous code,  cleaned up their footer to remove the "made by WordPress" and admin sign in links.  We also added a chat widget to added a chat widget to her website which still get's inquiries and leads to this day!  Lastly, we also updated the site to rank for some keywords and also convey the flight school's message better.

On the consultative side, we helped her and her team understand the analytics and data of her website to help drive better decisions with enrollment and recruiting.  We took a deep dive into their CRM to extract data which showed how many inquiries were coming in month after month.

Lastly before we ended our partnership, we helped them with graphic design and helped them launch their 30th year anniversary campaign.

While we are no longer partners as they make an effort to grow their in house team, we are proud to have helped during the transition.  The team at Cirrus Aviation is great and established and I can only wish for their continued success and growth.  One of Nayda's main missions was to transition away from the flight school business and instead become thought leaders in the aviation space.  I hope that she and her husband are able to achieve this soon!
