JayRone is a battle rapper in St. Louis, MO.  I met him during my college years when I too, was aiming to be a musician.  We collaborated a few times on some songs and we hanged out a lot.  He's a really good friend of mine.  He's one of my earlier inspirations for business and even to this day, I still find his tenacity and drive inspirational.  Every time I meet up with him, he has tons of new content.  New songs, music videos, battle rap events.  He just keeps going and going.

What really get's me is that more than a decade later, he's still honing his craft and making music.  Even in 2024, he still tours around the country battling other rappers and actually winning!  I really appreciate him because he believed in my abilities when I had nothing.  He was actually my first "client" if you will. 

He has a pretty large following in St. Louis and in the battle rap game and his music has over 10,000 streams a month on various platforms.

When I first started making website, I chose to use WordPress.  Even though I knew how to code from scratch, it was my first time actually using the platform.  I had tried other PHP based CMS (content management systems) like Drupal before, but never drank the WordPress koolaid until around 2019.

I got the website up and running with WordPress and it definitely did it's job.  But eventually,  the site looked outdated, was incredibly slow to load, and was a target for spam, hackers, and attacks.  Everyday, the site would receive countless brute force attacks and we would have to go through each file and folder of the website to make sure that it was clean and sanitized.

> WordPress is the main target for hacking attacks and spam.

So of course we updated his site.  For his site, we used Ruby on Rails.  Because it's on Rails, the site has less robot spam and hacker attempts.  It even has a log in where he can update his tour dates, add videos, and add music to the website.
