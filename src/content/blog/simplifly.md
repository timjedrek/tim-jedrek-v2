Blake found us online when I had just started Right Rudder Marketing.  At the time, they were also a fairly new flight school in Mesa's Falcon Field (KFFZ). They've gone through huge amounts of changes since Right Rudder Marketing first partnered with them.

I (and also the Right Rudder Marketing team) spend a good deal of time working through what their offer is.  When they first started, they did rentals and also had a type of ala carte service that you see at most flight schools.  You could just do your private or get your instrument rating.  They catered to everyone.  They allowed hobbyists and career track students into their flight programs.

As we worked through it, they continually refined their messaging and offer.  Now, they only admit career track zero to hero students.  They have batch start dates and defined schedules for their students.  It really is quite a work of art to see.  They doubled their revenue and now Blake, the owner, created systems to run the flight school with out him being involved in the day to day.  

Initially, when he founded the flight school with his partner JT, he forgoed continuing on to the airlines so he could continue to teach new students and share his love of aviation.  Now that SimpliFly is a well oiled machine, he has started airline pilot training and will be joining the airlines soon.

From the SEO and technical perspective, we've done a lot to push the needle even further.  We updated their website, implemented SEO tacts, and we run their Google Ads campaigns.  They first started at the bottom of Google maps and they were nowhere to be seen on the organic search rankings.

Now they're in the top 3 map pack and also on the top of organic search.  With each student committing over $80k for flight training, they've pushed themselves to gross over $6,000,000 in annual revenue.

We've been with them for over a year and I can't wait to see what next in store.  I also had the pleasure of visiting the school last year in September and took photos and videos for them to put on their social media and website.
