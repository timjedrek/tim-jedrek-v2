### Building an Onboarding Pipeline and Boosting SEO for High Tide Aviation

Working with Jessica, the owner of High Tide Aviation, has been a rewarding experience. She’s not only a skilled helicopter pilot but also a dedicated business owner with a vision for both flight training and scenic tours. Along with Ed, one of the managers, and her team, Jessica runs one of the best flight schools in the east coast! We’ve had the pleasure of helping them refine their marketing strategy. One key area we tackled was creating a solid onboarding pipeline for new students and improving their website and SEO to help grow their online presence.

### CRM and Streamlined Onboarding

One of the first challenges Jessica and Ed faced was managing all the leads coming in from both the tour side and the flight school. We implemented a CRM and integrated with Fare Harbour to help organize inquiries and make sure every lead was followed up on without anything slipping through the cracks. The system now tracks prospects from their initial inquiry through to enrollment, automating key steps like sending out TSA verification info and rental agreements. It’s saved the team countless hours and made the student onboarding experience much smoother.

### Automating and Personalizing the Student Journey

In addition to automation, we also made sure that the personal touch Jessica and Ed are known for wasn’t lost. We built out email sequences that feel personal and engaging, customized based on where the student is in their training journey. The goal was to create a seamless and supportive onboarding process that still feels like High Tide’s hands on, student first approach.  They also send out monthly newsletter using [Flight School CRM](https://flightschoolcrm.com).

### SEO That Drives Results

Beyond the CRM, we’ve done a ton of work on their SEO, which has helped them rise in rankings for both helicopter tours and flight training. For on-page SEO, we optimized both their **https://flyhightide.com** and **https://hightideaviation.com** sites by restructuring content, improving keyword targeting, and making sure meta tags, headers, and image alt texts were spot on. This made a huge difference in their visibility for key search terms like "helicopter tours in Southport" and "flight training in Beaufort."

Off-page, we focused on building High Tide’s authority through local citations and securing backlinks from relevant aviation websites. This has given them more domain authority and increased their rankings in competitive local searches. Now, they’re consistently showing up on the first page for their most important keywords, driving more organic traffic to both the tour and flight school sides of the business.

### Seeing the Impact

Since implementing the new CRM workflows and boosting their SEO, High Tide has seen a noticeable increase in student enrollments and tour bookings. The combination of a smoother onboarding pipeline and better search rankings has given them more time to focus on what matters most—flying and training. It’s been exciting to watch their growth, and I’m looking forward to continuing our work together as their business keeps expanding.
