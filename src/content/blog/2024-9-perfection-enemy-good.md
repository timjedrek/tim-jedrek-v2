We've been working on revising the Right Rudder Marketing website for about two months.  The original website was my baby so to speak.  I had coded it from scratch back in 2022 when I first launched the company and it had grown to a behemoth of a website full of articles, posts, content, and forms.

It was a very good website, but I knew that it needed an overhaul.  The company has changed so much since that website got launched that I knew we needed to refresh the page and really put pen to paper as far as what Right Rudder Marketing is all about.

I'm writing this post today, because I realized that I was holding my team back.  My web developer (and recently promoted to marketing manager), Raul, had worked to import all of the posts into a new website.  He refactored the Ruby on Rails code to Astro, a javascript framework we now use for all of our clients and future clients' websites.

Him and I would meet and look at the new website and revise and edit.  Revise and edit.  Revise and edit.  We'd keep tweaking things around and for some reason, I just would never get satisfied with the work.

Then, yesterday as I was working on the new website, it hit me.  I was hindering my team.  I was letting perfection get in the way of done.  I wasn't letting go and trusting the process.

> I was letting perfection get in the way of done.  

It was me who took this company from a simple side gig to full scale digital marketing agency approaching $1M in annual revenue!  It was me who designed the website and got our first handful of flight school clients.  It was me who did all of that, and I just wasn't able to let go.

So yea, I'm writing this post because I'm sure there are tons of other business owners in similar shoes as myself.  We did things a certain way and we're afraid.. that's right..  I said afraid.  We're afraid of letting go of the reins.  We want to have full control and we want everything to be perfect.

Now don't get me wrong.  We shouldn't accept mediocrity either.  But if you've got 99% of the work done and your spending weeks or months on the last 1%... it might be time to accept that **your letting perfection be the enemy of done**.

So this is my encouragement to anyone reading this out there.  Pull the trigger and finish the project.  Stop procrastinating and commit to completion.

Similar to landing a plane.  Yes, we need to strive for perfection and do things right.  But we still need to commit to an action after we've made the decision.

Make your decision and own it.  Finish and commit.  Just do it.

Here is the new website.  It's much more sleeker and has better design.  I also think that it highlights more of what we've been working on and how we've been helping flight schools grow and enroll more student pilots.
