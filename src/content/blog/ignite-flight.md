> Working with Tim and the Right Rudder Marketing Team has been a pleasure. Trusting the expertise of Right Rudder Marketing has saved me from the costly mistakes of engaging a marketing agency unfamiliar with the flight training business. <br><br>- Bill Heckathorn, Ignite Flight Academy

As the owner of Right Rudder Marketing, I’ve had the privilege of working with many flight schools across the country, helping them grow their student base through digital marketing. One of my proudest partnerships is with Ignite Flight Academy, based in Lincoln, Nebraska.  I first met Bill Heckathorn, the owner of Ignite Flight Academy, at the King Schools EDU-CON conference and I am so proud of the growth of their flight school and having the opportunity to help the school with their marketing.

Ignite Flight Academy is the number one flight school in Lincoln, NE.  They had a solid presence in the Lincoln, NE area and they were looking to expand their school further and enroll more students.  They knew they needed more students to enroll from outside their immediate area, and Google Ads was the key to making that happen.  Ignite was already using Google Ads to attract prospective students, but they needed more fine-tuning to make the most of their campaigns. The primary goal was to draw students from larger markets like Omaha and even neighboring states like South Dakota.

We started by doing a full audit of their Google Ads campaigns, identifying areas where budget was being spent but not yielding results. Then, we restructured their campaigns to focus on specific geographic regions—targeting people who had expressed interest in flight training but weren’t aware of Ignite’s offerings. By carefully selecting keywords, optimizing their ad copy, and targeting the right demographics, we were able to bring in more qualified leads.

Within months, Ignite saw a marked increase in inquiries and enrollments from outside of Lincoln. Students from Omaha started to consider the short commute, and even some students from South Dakota found that the quality of training and affordability at Ignite made the trip well worth it.

At Right Rudder Marketing, we take pride in helping our clients grow beyond their initial expectations. Ignite Flight Academy is a perfect example of how a well executed Google Ads strategy, combined with a clear focus on expanding geographically, can yield incredible results. If you’re a flight school looking to grow your enrollment and reach new markets, we’re ready to help you take off!
