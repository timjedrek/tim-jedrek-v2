Summit Flight Academy partnered with us to help grow their school and do their marketing right.  Jeremy, the owner of Summit Flight Academy, had done his digital marketing by himself and grew the flight school to about $1M in annual revenue.  With a background in IT and marketing, he was well equipped to handle the initial stages of a well thought out digital marketing campaign.

However, as his flight school grew he knew that investing in a marketing agency was the right decision.  In order to scale to multiple seven figures, new challenges arise and as the CEO of a growing successful business, time becomes more and more limited.  In addition, having a team of experts on your side is what is required to achieve next level growth.

When we first partnered with Jeremy and the Summit Flight Academy team, we looked at his existing work and offered ways to improve his marketing and his systems.  Starting with his website, we upgraded from Wix to a fully customized and  programmed from scratch website.  Programming the website from scratch meant that we could implement custom features like interactive forms and pricing calculators - features that would be hard to make work with no-code page builders like Wix and WordPress.

In addition, we installed our [Flight School CRM](https://flightschoolcrm.com) at his school and migrated from the previous Wix CRM tools.  Besides basic CRM functions like managing leads, [Flight School CRM](https://flightschoolcrm.com) has features that allow for bulk email sending and automatons.  

Using the [Flight School CRM](https://flightschoolcrm.com), we helped him launch his new multi-engine program.  In addition to the social media posts that were put out, we used the included bulk email feature to send an email notification to his qualified students notifying them of the new program.  It marketed as a program with limited availability to spur excitement and interest in the program.  Within a week, the program was fully booked.

Looking to the future, we are looking to implement more aspects of the [Flight School Marketing System](httpsL//rightruddermarketing.com/marketing-system) and include running targeted PPC campaigns and expand his audience to more qualified prospective pilots in the Kansas City area.

It has been a great several month working and partnering with the team at Summit Flight Academy.  I'm excited to see what's next for Summit Flight Academy.
