> At Red Arrow Flight Academy, we have had an exceptional experience working with Right Rudder Marketing. They completely transformed our website, enhancing its usability and enriching it with valuable content that effectively helps us capture new potential customers. The Right Rudder team is consistently proactive, not only in maintaining our site but also in seeking innovative ways to support our business. They excel at turning our ideas into reality and are genuinely wonderful to collaborate with. A key aspect we particularly appreciate is their expertise in aviation and flight school marketing, which was a crucial need we were missing when in search for marketing help. If you're searching for a marketing team that provides outstanding results and stellar customer service, Right Rudder Marketing is the perfect choice. <br><br>- Vanessa, Red Arrow Flight Academy

I first met Vanessa at the NAFI summit in Lakeland, FL back in October 2023 after giving a talk on [sales and marketing](https://rightruddermarketing.com/notams/tim-jedrek-at-king-schools-talks-sales-and-marketing).  Vanessa had many questions on social media marketing, website conversions, and tracking.  A brief yet fruitful and enjoyable conversation.  We parted ways and said we would meet later.  In the following months, I talked with Vanessa and also Elsa, another member of the leadership team at Red Arrow.

We later became partners in January 2024 and we got to work.  They were coming off the Wix platform and hired us to not only revamp their website, but also be strategic in ways to grow their business and help their operations.  In addition upgrading their website and doing SEO, we created a customer portal for their student pilots to access and view documents.  We also implemented [FSCRM (Flight School Customer Relationship Management)](https://docs.flightschoolcrm.com) software.

It's been a great honor working with Tom, the founder of Red Arrow, and Vanessa and Elsa, Red Arrow's leadership team, to grow their flight school business with marketing.  They dominate the local market and have **2-5 prospective student pilot inquiries per day** asking about flight training and their school.  I'm proud to help train more pilots in the El Paso, TX and Santa Maria, NM area.  Can't wait to see what's in store for them!
