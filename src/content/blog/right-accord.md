### Proud to Help Right Accord Health Care

My aunt, Rosemarie, founded Right Accord Private Duty Home Health Care decades ago when she moved to Sarasota, FL, and has grown it into a trusted home care agency. Rosemarie has always been an inspiration to me, with her leadership and entrepreneurial spirit driving the business forward. Recently, she reached out to me personally for help in modernizing her online presence.

### Adapting Flight School Strategies for Health Care

After seeing the success of my work in the flight school industry, Rosemarie wanted to apply similar techniques to her home health care agency. Although Right Accord is a different field, the core strategies for digital marketing — like having a strong online presence and targeted ads — are universal. Together, we worked on redesigning her website to reflect the professionalism and care Right Accord provides, while also optimizing it for search engines and user experience.

### CRM Consulting to Improve Client Management

In addition to the website work, we focused on consulting her team regarding CRM use. While she’s not using the same CRM platform as our flight school clients, the principles of efficient lead management, follow-up automation, and customer retention have proven just as effective. With better CRM systems in place, Right Accord can now stay organized, communicate more effectively, and provide personalized care to their clients.  Before, she was not tracking the leads and inquiries to her business.  We helped revamp her CRM system to integrate with her website so that they can now get detailed reporting and have a clear picture of who walked in the door and who needs to be followed up on.

### Running Targeted Google Ads

We also launched a Google Ads PPC campaign to target families and individuals searching for home care services in the Sarasota area. The goal was to increase visibility and drive more inquiries, focusing on the services that make Right Accord unique, such as Alzheimer’s care and live-in caregiving. By carefully managing and tweaking the ad campaigns, we’ve seen increased traffic and lead conversions for the agency.

### Seeing the Results

It’s been incredibly rewarding to see how these changes have helped Right Accord grow. I’m proud to have played a role in supporting her vision, and I’m excited to continue helping Right Accord thrive.

### Marketing for Health Care Agencies?

Looking ahead, there’s a lot of potential for Right Accord to continue growing. As we refine the marketing strategy and improve their digital presence, I’ve been thinking about the broader possibilities. One day, I may take my expertise in flight school marketing and apply it to the healthcare industry for other home health care agencies as well. Rosemarie’s journey with Right Accord has inspired me to consider expanding my businesses to other healthcare agencies that could benefit from the same techniques we’ve used to grow Right Accord.
