### Proud to Partner with Tampa Bay Aviation

One of the partnerships I’m most proud of at Right Rudder Marketing is with Tampa Bay Aviation. Our key account manager, Charles, was instrumental in bringing them on board. He reached out to Flint, the owner, and has maintained a strong relationship with the team ever since. Charles meets with Michelle and Oxana multiple times a month to tweak and improve our strategies, ensuring their CRM continues to run smoothly.

### CRM and the Management Plan

At Tampa Bay Aviation, we handle all of their [CRM](https://flightschoolcrm.com/#pricing) needs under our **Management Plan**. This means ongoing, personalized support, unlike the **Access Plan**, where schools handle things themselves. For Flint’s team, we manage lead tracking, automate follow-ups, and ensure all workflows are running optimally. Regular check-ins allow us to continually adjust the system to match their evolving needs.

### Improving Processes Through Regular Strategy Sessions

Meeting regularly with Tampa Bay Aviation has allowed us to keep things flexible and responsive. Charles works closely with Michelle and Oxana to ensure that the CRM is always aligned with their goals. These strategy sessions allow us to make real time adjustments, like refining automated sequences or adding new workflows to capture more leads. It’s all about making their process as seamless as possible.

### The Difference with the Management Plan

Being on the **Management Plan** means Tampa Bay Aviation gets more than just software.  They get ongoing service and support. Whenever they need an update or change, we’re there to make it happen quickly. Our email-based support is always available, but the real value comes from the monthly check-ins where we discuss what's working and what could be improved. That level of involvement has made a big difference for them.

### Seeing the Results

Since partnering with Tampa Bay Aviation, we’ve seen their operations become more streamlined and efficient, leading to better customer engagement and improved student management. The consistent collaboration between our team and theirs has allowed them to focus more on what they do best — flight training and tours — while we handle the CRM side of things. It’s been a rewarding journey, and we’re excited to continue helping them grow.
