### A Strong Partnership with NextGen Flight Academy

I first met Mac, the owner of NextGen Flight Academy, at a FSANA event. He had recently purchased the flight school and knew he needed to bring the website up to date. Amanda, part of the leadership team, had been following Right Rudder Marketing’s webinars and podcasts and saw the potential. She was instrumental in pushing the deal forward, and now, we work closely with Amanda every month to fine tune their marketing strategy.

### Website Redesign for Better Lead Generation

When Mac first approached us, the NextGen website needed a complete refresh to reflect the school’s professionalism and training capabilities. We revamped the site to improve user experience, making it easier for prospective students to find information and sign up for programs. With a clear structure and optimized design, the new site has helped capture more leads and showcase the full range of training options available, from private pilot to commercial licenses.

### SEO That Increases Visibility

Along with the website redesign, we implemented a focused SEO strategy. By targeting key terms like “pilot training in Riverside” and “flight schools in Redlands,” we’ve helped NextGen climb the rankings in Google searches. Optimizing on-page elements such as meta tags, keywords, and content structure has increased organic traffic significantly, making it easier for students to discover their programs.

### Running Successful PPC Campaigns

In addition to organic search, we’ve been running Google Ads PPC campaigns to drive immediate traffic. By focusing on high-converting keywords and setting up targeted ads, we’ve seen an increase in inquiries from aspiring pilots looking to join NextGen’s programs. Amanda’s leadership has been key here, as she works closely with us to adjust campaigns based on monthly KPI reviews.

### Results and Looking Ahead

Since partnering with NextGen, we’ve seen steady growth in both student inquiries and enrollments. Working alongside Amanda during our monthly meetings, we continuously adjust the strategy to meet the school’s evolving needs. It’s been a rewarding journey so far, and we’re excited to keep helping NextGen soar to new heights.
