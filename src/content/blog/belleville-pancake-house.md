Maria, one of the owners of Belleville Pancake House, was one of my colleague at Tyson Foods.  I worked with her closely whenever I visited the bakery part of the factory.  I really gotta give it up for Maria for trusting me with creating her website.  As one of my first websites, this was also built on WordPress.

They're still in business even after COVID and they're still getting traffic both physically and on their website.  As I continued to learn WordPress, a plugin called Elementor came into view.  Elementor is a really cool drag and drop plug in where you can add different dynamic components and animations to the website.  

What I soon found out though was using these plugins had limitations.  And some of the really cool looking and better designed components charged a monthly subscription fee.  Just another reason to ditch the WordPress ecosystem.  Anyways, I was still able to build the site without needing to subscribe to a monthly plugin.  And it gave me the impetus to really up my game with HTML, CSS, and javascript.  

It's a simple WordPress website and it does the job.  The website was a great stepping stone to growing my website business and I really enjoyed working with Maria and her team.  Without her buy in, I would have never kept chasing the dream of running a full scale digital marketing agency.

If you're ever in town and want to grab some delicious breakfast, lunch, or dinner; I encourage you to check them out!
