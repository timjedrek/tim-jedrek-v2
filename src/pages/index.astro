        I'm on a mission to find 100 flight schools in the world to partner with and double their student body.  Everyday, I work with the team at Right Rudder Marketing to implement and execute the latest technical strategies and tactics to move flight school businesses up higher on Google search. Our collective goal is to get those flight schools known to their prospective students.  Through our efforts we've helped flight schools in America achieve:

      <ul class="list-disc ml-10 my-5">
        <li>Bringing flight schools to over $1M in annual revenue</li>
        <li>10X the number of leads coming in a flight school</li>
        <li>Doubling flight school student body and flight time brining in ov $3M in annual revenue</li>
        <li>Double the amount of Google reviews at a flight school in under 6 months</li>
        <li>Dominating in a flight school's local service area and ranking #1 on Google Maps and organic search</li>
      </ul>
      <text class="text-lg">
        I started Right Rudder Marketing over a year ago and I am so grateful for the growth of the company and of our flight school partners.  It truly is awe inspiring to see our flight schools transform their operations into large scalable businesses.  I love being a part of that because I know that by growing our flight schools' businesses, it drives more people into aviation and brings more pilots into the industry.
